# JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator

This challenge forms part of the course work for week 3, Module 3, set by the University of Birmingham and Trilogy Ltd's Coding Bootcamp.

## Project Description
---

The aim of this challenge was to create a password generator application that can be used to generate a random password, based on user selected criteria. 

## Project Requirements
---

This challenge required the underlying JavaScript code that randomly generates a password, and dynamically updates the user interface, to be written. The HTML, and CSS files were provided as starter code.

### Starter Code Mock-up

The functionality that the JavaScript needs to implement is defined by the user story and acceptance criteria listed below.  



### User Story
```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

```


### Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

```
